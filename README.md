# Business Objective:
# What is Failure To Deliver and Settle
Failure to deliver refers to a situation where one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation. Such failures occur when a buyer (the party with a long position) does not have enough money to take delivery and pay for the transaction at settlement. A failure can also occur when the seller (the party with a short position) does not own all or any of the underlying assets required at settlement, and so cannot make the delivery.
